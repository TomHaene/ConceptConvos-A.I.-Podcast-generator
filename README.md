# ConceptConvos

Concept Convos is a web application that creates a short podcast with your two favourite celebrities, using topics that you decide! There are currently over 7 different famous stars/characters to choose from, leading to 50+ combinations of voices to keep you entertained for hours!

Our main inspiration came from watching AI-generated YouTube videos. While endlessly scrolling through the app, we found so many examples of celebrities having their voices cloned using AI tools. We saw endless potential in these technologies, and were especially intrigued by the interactions between these trained computer models. With a team that listens to several podcasts, we were always left wanting our favorite celebrities to be guests on our favourite shows! And so, we created Concept Convos.

The web application was built using the Flask microweb framework, and coded using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This interface allows users to input their desired celebrities, as well as a prompt for the podcast generation. We also implemented a progress bar, as well as a podcast viewing page. Using Flask and Python, we were able to utilize the OpenAI API for generating the script of the podcast, as well as the Play.HT API for generating the voice sound files.
